### CTA Line Planning Brief

#### Scenario

The city of Chicago will be opening up a new CTA train line in 2030, though the effort is constrained by demographic and economic dynamism, [public opinion and sensitivity](https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2015/05/04/chicago-is-the-most-segregated-city-in-america-analysis/) relating to the long history of [segregation in the city](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-diverse-cities-are-often-the-most-segregated/), [budgetary](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Budget-2019-Budget-Recommendations-Appropriations/mmee-zjgx) realities, [existing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_%22L%22#History) bus and light rail [public transit coverage](https://www.transitchicago.com/maps/) and [ridership](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?q=ridership&sortBy=relevance), and [land lease and zoning](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Boundaries-Zoning-Districts-current-/7cve-jgbp) feasibility. As a result, a computational model is required to better understand the mutually oppositional pressures — and generate alternative proposals for consideration. 

[Several](http://www.gapersblock.com/detour/a_cta_map_for_2055/) [urban](https://www.cnt.org/projects/transit-future) [planning bodies](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-metra-electric-discussions-20160623-story.html) have attacked the problem from the singular motivation of [better interconnecting existing routes](https://www.transitchicago.com/planning/circle/), but those proposals were driven largely by urban planning orthodoxy and minimal investment thinking. Read through their opinions, research other existing proposals, and gain a good sense of the interconnected web of issues that confronts the CTA in this venture. Then, plot your transit line under the following conditions.

#### Requirements and Constraints

- The new line must pass through at least one of the following busy transfer stations: Roosevelt (Green, Red, Orange), Fullerton or Belmont (Red ,Brown, Purple), Ashland (Green, Pink), Clark/Lake (Blue, Orange, Purple, Brown, Pink, Green), or Harold Washington Library (Brown, Pink, Orange, Purple) 
- The new line can only add up to 15 new stops that are unique to itself (The average CTA line has 15.25 unique stops). It can freely intersect and reuse existing stations from all other CTA lines.
- The new line must be shorter than 14 miles, or 22.5 kilometers long (The average CTA line is 14.01 miles long).
- The new line can be a terminal line (has a beginning and end) or a circular line (the line connects all stations in a continuous clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation), but should not branch into separate segments.
- In designing the new line, consider intersecting with existing bus routes and Metra stations
- No new technologies will be available for the project, so the new line will be far less costly as an elevated or surface line, rather than a subterranean line. Consider the visual and auditory impact of your line on Chicago’s population and businesses.

Sourcing whatever datasets you can find that address as many of the above topics as you are interested and more, create a model for *determining what neighborhoods of the city are most in need of new rail transit investment*. 

#### Motivation 

As a citizen of the city, model in **what you believe** the CTA should be taking into account in addition to the above topics. Then, make a case for a specific elevated/subway train route and stations, additional to existing transit infrastructure. Defend you point of view, **provide a few runner-up alternatives**, cite your data, and explain what your model strives to reconcile. This might take the form of a principal model that considers CTA-centric beliefs, and then a revised model that factors in other considerations that you believe to be important in the construction of a new rail line. These additional considerations are intended to be, in this exercise, one way of getting into to our discussions of bias, positionality, and belief. 

#### Deliverables

- [CTA map of Chicago](https://www.transitchicago.com/maps/) with your line and stations added (in a new color!)
- 1 Page (300-500 words) explanation of your model, confidence in your outcomes, mathematics, data sources, missing data, proposals, and implications. 
- As many pages needed of tables, calculations, and statistical work to justify your outcomes
