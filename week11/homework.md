### Homework

Find 5 datasets, at the country level, that you think might be related to one of 23 official [UNHCR *Active Situations* in worldwide migration patterns](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations). Do some secondary research on that situation.

Analyze the p and R-square values to determine if the data in your datasets is *related* and *significant*.

Please upload your datasets to the class drive folder.
