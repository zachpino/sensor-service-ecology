### Modeling a Bikeshare System

Python is a very powerful and easy to learn programming language, which can be used for applications as [diverse](https://www.python.org/success-stories/) as website coding, robotics, software development for desktop and mobile applications, firmware development for embedded devices, generative design, scientific computing, video and special effects for movies, and system architecture. In combination with various tools for data [analysis](http://www.numpy.org), [information extraction and manipulation](https://pandas.pydata.org), [statistical modeling](https://www.scipy.org), [data journalism presentation](https://jupyter.org), [machine learning](https://www.tensorflow.org), and [visualization ](https://matplotlib.org) libraries — is the language sitting at the heart of the contemporary explosion in data-driven modeling.

##### Short History of Python

The late 1980's were an awkward time in computer programming. The ease of development of the early world wide web via the early specifications for HTML and PHP were attracting newcomers into programming. Other common programming languages available at the time like C++ and BASIC — designed for more traditional and broader programming applications — effectively demanded tremendous exposure to computer science principles and best practices before they could be used by amateur programmers. Tutorials and learning resources for these traditional languages were scarce, but the quick diffusion of web programming knowledge through informal websites and chat rooms and the ease of website creation exposed that an appetite and ability for programming existed outside of inwards-looking computer science communities.

[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), a Dutch computer scientist, saw this discrepancy in 1991 and began developing a language to help transition programmers away from the declarative languages of the web and towards the use of more powerful languages — and that effort was named [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) after Van Rossum's favorite British comedy group [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python). Not :snake:. Many references to comedy work from the group exist in Python tutorials, and the Python community holds humorous punning as one of its core values. Van Rossum is currently, and as an in-joke always will be, the [benevolent dictator for life (BDFL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) of Python — though it is a fully [open source project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) with thousands of contributors across the planet.

Python is designed to be easy to learn and human-readable. Towards this end, whitespace (tabs, space, and returns) is semantic in Python unlike in most other programming languages. Additional eccentricities include [optional data typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#DYNAMIC), easy transitions between [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and [object-oriented]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming() programming paradigms, and a comprehensive but easily extensible [standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_library).
